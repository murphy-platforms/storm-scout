### MySQL Migration (Completed)
- ✅ Updated `package.json`: replaced `sql.js` with `mysql2`
- ✅ Rewrote `database.js` for MySQL connection pooling
- ✅ Converted `schema.sql` from SQLite to MySQL syntax
- ✅ Converted `seed.sql` from SQLite to MySQL syntax
- ✅ Updated `config.js` with MySQL credentials structure

- ✅ Fixed SQL parsing to handle comment lines properly
- ✅ Converted site model and routes to async/await
- ✅ Created MySQL-compatible stubs for advisory and siteStatus models
- ✅ Set up SSH access with key-based authentication

## ❌ Issues Encountered

### SQLite Compatibility Problems
1. **better-sqlite3**: Requires GLIBC 2.29 (server has older version)
2. **sql.js**: Out of memory - WebAssembly instantiation failed on shared hosting

## 🎯 Current Status

**✅ FULLY DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL**

**Production Site:** https://your-domain.example.com

**On Server:**
- Database: `***REDACTED***` (MariaDB 11.4.9) - ✅ Schema created, 219 sites loaded
- Backend API: ✅ Running with all endpoints functional
- Frontend: ✅ Dashboard accessible and operational
- Node.js: ✅ Running on version 20.20.0
- SSH Access: ✅ Configured for deployment
- NOAA Ingestion: ✅ Running every 15 minutes (431 active advisories)

**FTP Upload Paths:**
- FTP uploads to: `/home/REDACTED_USER/your-domain.example.com/stormscout/`
- Node.js app expects: `/home/REDACTED_USER/storm-scout/`
- Must copy files: `cp -r ~/your-domain.example.com/stormscout/* ~/storm-scout/`

## 📋 Completed Deployment Steps

1. ✅ Configured SSH access with Ed25519 key
2. ✅ Deployed backend files via SSH/rsync
3. ✅ Installed mysql2 and dependencies
4. ✅ Initialized MySQL database schema
5. ✅ Seeded database with 219 testing center sites

**System:**
- ✅ `GET /health` - Health check
- ✅ `GET /api` - API information
- ✅ `GET /` - Frontend dashboard (HTML)

## ✅ Completed Conversions

### Backend Models (All MySQL async/await)
- ✅ `site.js` - Site data access
- ✅ `advisory.js` - Weather advisory management
- ✅ `notice.js` - System notices  
- ✅ `siteStatus.js` - Operational status tracking

### Routes

- ✅ Notices routes fully functional

### Data Ingestion
- ✅ NOAA API integration working
- ✅ Ingestion code converted to MySQL
- ✅ Scheduler running every 15 minutes
- ✅ 432 alerts → 436 advisories → 101 sites impacted

### Frontend
- ✅ All files deployed to public_html
- ✅ API endpoint URLs updated for production
- ✅ Static file serving configured in Express
- ✅ Dashboard accessible at root domain
- ✅ All pages functional (Dashboard, Sites, Advisories, Notices, Sources)

## 📚 Documentation Created

- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Full VPS deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT-CPANEL.md` - cPanel-specific deployment
- `DEPLOY.md` - Quick deployment guide
- `deploy-ftp.sh` - Automated FTP deployment script
- `.ftpconfig` - FTP configuration (not in git)
- `PROGRESS.md` - This file

## 🚀 Why MySQL?

MySQL/MariaDB is the best choice for this hosting environment:
- ✅ Already installed and available in cPanel
- ✅ No native compilation needed
- ✅ Better performance for concurrent connections
- ✅ More suitable for production web applications
- ✅ Standard for shared hosting environments
- ✅ Better tooling and management via phpMyAdmin

## 📝 Notes

- Local development uses Node 20 LTS via Homebrew
- SSH access not available (FTP-only deployment)
- Frontend files uploaded separately from backend
- cPanel auto-manages node_modules in virtual environment
